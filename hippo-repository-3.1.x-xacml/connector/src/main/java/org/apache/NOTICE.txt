Note that this directory contains parts of source code of a sandbox
Apache JackRabbit project.

Only slight modifications have been done in order to allow this source
to be run with JackRabbit 1.4, in combination with the patch which is
also here and is part of the sandbox project.

Both a update ot JackRabbit trunk and a release of the spi-rmi project
are required to move this source out of Hippo ECM source basis.
